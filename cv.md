1. Yauh Ask
2. Contact information via GitHub
3. Ambitions and intentions depend on the projects I succeed to achieve. Currently I do know basics of Git, Docker, Kubernetes, JS and Python.
4. I anticipated this question in the previous one. To add up, I am familiar with DevSecOps movement, particularly, SCRUM methodology, CI and CD via GitLan and GitHub Actions. Sometimes I explore Python via penetration testing tools, and Kali Linux. Knowledge of virtualization ain't scraring me too.
